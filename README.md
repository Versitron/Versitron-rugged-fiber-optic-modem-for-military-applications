## Fiber Optic Modem with Electrical Isolation for Ground-Loop Prevention

**Fiber-based transmission to eliminate ground loops and electrical interference risks.**

- Fiber inherently provides electrical isolation between endpoints — preventing ground loops, surges, and common-mode noise  
- Ideal for installations with mixed grounding, long cable runs, or sensitive equipment such as sensors, control panels, or surveillance gear  
- Ensures stable, clean data and control signals, especially in industrial or electrically noisy environments  
- Works with serial interfaces (RS-232, RS-422, RS-485) or other data/control links converted to fiber  

This makes it a strong choice for industrial plants, remote monitoring sites, and secure communication systems where reliability and signal integrity matter.

## Industrial Micromodem

**Compact, high-reliability fiber modems for industrial and SCADA networks.**

- Converts serial data signals (e.g., RS-232, RS-422, RS-485) or sensor/telemetry data to fiber for long-distance communication  
- Designed for continuous 24/7 operation in demanding industrial environments — utilities, manufacturing plants, pipelines, automation systems  
- Supports stable data transmission over fiber, free from electrical noise and surges  
- Facilitates integration of legacy serial-based equipment into modern fiber networks without rewiring major infrastructure  

Ideal for factories, utilities, transportation, and industrial control systems requiring dependable long-haul communication.

## Fiber Optic Security Infrastructure

**Comprehensive fiber-based backbone for secure data, video, and control communication.**

- Combines rugged modems, fiber links, and secure configuration for facility-wide security networks  
- Supports video surveillance, access control, sensor networks, alarm systems, and secure data transmission on a unified fiber backbone  
- Resistant to tapping, EMI, surges, and physical interference — enhancing overall security posture  
- Scalable to small facilities or large complexes, with support for modular expansion as needed  

Suitable for secure government buildings, data centers, industrial campuses, and critical infrastructure facilities.
